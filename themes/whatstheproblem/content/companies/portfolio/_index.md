At the core of this syndicate is a podcast that serves as the catalyst for connecting investors with entrepreneurs who share a common ethos â€” an obsession with the problem they are solving. The podcast, a rich tapestry of interviews, unveils the narratives of these trailblazers who prioritize the impact of their solutions over the mere act of selling a product.

We recognize the authenticity of founders who are more passionate about understanding and addressing the intricacies of the problems they tackle than merely pushing a product to market. Investors in this syndicate become part of a movement that transcends traditional investment paradigms. They are not just backers; they are champions of a philosophy that celebrates the relentless pursuit of solutions.
