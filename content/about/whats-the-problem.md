How are we different? WtP is not intended for just startup enthusiasts. It is intended for anyone interested in learning about some of the biggest environmental and societal issues we face today.

In the fast-paced world of startups, Aakash Kapur delved deep into the grit beneath the glamour. His podcast during his MBA wasn’t about showcasing shiny companies or charismatic leaders; it was about uncovering the real challenges driving these founders.

Aakash and Amrit Sami’s paths crossed during a program called Future VC. Both were hustling hard in the world of venture capital and startups, pounding the pavement in search of their next steps.
Life got busy, and their podcast faded into the background. Aakash explored the operational side, testing the waters at an AI unicorn before chasing the rush of early-stage roles. Amrit carved her path in VC, landing a spot at Symvan Capital.

They remained as friends and support resources for each other through job hunts and frustration in the industry, bonding over shared gripes about inclusivity and misconceptions about talent. Then came a lightbulb moment—they decided to revive the podcast. Aakash and Amrit agreed to keep it real by ensuring a diverse lineup, aiming for a 50-50 split between male and female guests. Their podcast ethos remained solid: it’s all about the problem-solving savvy of entrepreneurs with genuine expertise, not just the gloss of their products.

Their podcast became a hub where the nitty-gritty of entrepreneurship took center stage, proving that true innovation stems from understanding and tackling the toughest challenges head-on.
